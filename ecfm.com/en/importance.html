		The Power of Feedback  	</div>
	<div id="cerpara">
		Most people in the workplace suffer from a lack of performance feedback. At Full Circle Feedback we call this condition the “Feedback Famine” and we believe it is rife in many organisations. The Feedback Famine occurs even in very small organisations and in teams. It also occurs at all levels of an organisation.	</div>

			Why is Feedback Important?
			</div>
			<div class="blogpara">
			Feedback is the cheapest, most powerful, yet, most under used management tool that we have at our disposal. Feedback is powerful as it helps people get on track, it serves as a guide to assist people to know how they and others perceive their performance.<br><br>

Feedback can also be very motivating and energizing. It has strong links to employee satisfaction and productivity. People like to feel involved and identified with their organisation. Feedback can help achieve that state.<br><br>

We have observed after working with hundreds of managers in all kinds of organisations that the most effective leaders have good antennae – they understand the impact that their behavior has on others. They subscribe to the time honored maxim – First know thyself! We do not have to agree with people’s perceptions but it is important to be aware of them. It is useful information that can inform our decisions and strategies.<br><br>

Working without feedback is similar to setting out an important journey minus a map or signposts. You may have a great sense of direction but this may not be sufficient to keep you on track. When people receive little feedback they tend to either be overly self critical or self congratulatory. This is because they are relying upon events rather than specific feedback to measure their performance and impact. For example Jane’s manager had not ever told her that he found her too inclined to agree with him. It was not until the third time that she had been overlooked for promotion that her manager eventually told her that he felt she lacked decisiveness and was not assertive enough to be a senior manager. Jane was left wondering why she had not been given this feedback during a three year period. Unless she had asked for verbal feedback, the only feedback she would have received indirectly was the fact that she was being overlooked.<br><br>

It is very difficult to be very self aware without feedback from others. Self awareness and monitoring provide a good platform but feedback from others informs us in ways that enriches our self knowledge. We no longer need to waste energy on explaining our behavior and people do not waste energy on trying to predict our behavior. It’s called open communication!

			How Feedback Helps 
			</div>
			<div class="blogpara">
Feedback helps people find answers to these vital questions:<br><br>

    Why does my role exist?<br>
    What am I supposed to achieve?<br>
    How is my performance tracking?<br>
    What is the best use of my time?<br>
    How do I influence others?<br>
    What is the quality of my relationships with my students, team members and colleagues?<br><br><br>

Feedback is the information we all need to be truly effective in the workplace. In fact the most effective leaders actively seek feedback to enhance their performance. These leaders intuitively recognize the power of feedback.<br><br>
